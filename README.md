# Readings In ML And Distributed Systems

List of papers I find interesting.

## ML

* [Learning from Imbalanced Data](http://www.ele.uri.edu/faculty/he/PDFfiles/ImbalancedLearning.pdf)
* ["Why Should I Trust You?" Explaining the Predictions of Any Classifier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf)
* [XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754.pdf)


## Model Deployment

* [Data Management Challenges in Production Machine Learning](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45a9dcf23dbdfa24dbced358f825636c58518afa.pdf) (2017) *Tutorial about data-management issues that arise in the context of machine learning pipelines deployed in production.*

* [What’s your ML Test Score? A rubric for ML production systems](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/45742.pdf) (2016) -- *Using machine learning in real-world production systems is complicated by a host of issues not found in small toy examples or even large offline research experiments. Testing and monitoring are key considerations for assessing the production-readiness of an ML system. Authors present an ML Test Score rubric based on a set of actionable tests to help quantify these issues.*

* [Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning System](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf) (2015) -- *Authors explore several ML-specific risk factors to account for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configuration issues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.*

* [A framework for monitoring classifiers’ performance: when and why failure occurs?](https://www3.nd.edu/~nchawla/papers/KAIS09.pdf) (2009) *This article implements a comprehensive evaluation framework to proactively detect breakpoints in classifiers’ predictions and shifts in data distributions through a series of statistical tests.*

* [Rules of Machine Learning: Best Practices for ML Engineering](http://martin.zinkevich.org/rules_of_ml/rules_of_ml.pdf) *This document is intended to help those with a basic knowledge of machine learning get the benefit of best practices in machine learning from around Google.*
